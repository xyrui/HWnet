## Prepare data

### Training dataset
1. Please download CAVE DATAset from https://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/multispectral/ for training. The image size is of 512\*512\*31.

2. Crop your own training dataset. I randomly select 20 images for training and crop about 10000 patches of size 96\*96\*20. (This step is implemented by MATLAB code and I did not add the code here. You could freely choose your favourite way.) 

3. Save the training dataset in path "dataroot"(your own data path).

### Testing dataset
Please refer to "data" file for creating your own test data. The noise generation methods in "data/utils" file are in consistent with those in "lib.py".  

## Training and testing
Plean refer to "train_hwnet.py" and "test.py" for training and testing HWLRMF. More test codes for NAILRMA, NGmeet, LLRT and their weighted versions will be uploaded soon.
